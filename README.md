This project will focus on the use of a convolutional neural network that has been specially trained for this case. After a thorough analysis of the language, the approach will be to provide an evaluation of nine common types of errors in English that have been carefully selected to assess each phrase the user pronounces. The goal is to develop an interface where users must read phrases in English and, by passing these phrases in real-time through our neural network, receive an automated and detailed evaluation of their performance. This approach aims to provide an effective tool to explain in a very personalized way what errors each person might have when speaking English, which can be crucial for their language learning.
